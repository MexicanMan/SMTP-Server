# SMTP Server
A SMTP server implementation made for a networking course.

## Build
To build we use make, so you can simply put:
* `make` - to build both server and client in debug mode by default
* `make build=[release|debug]` - to build both server and client in preferred mode
* `make [build=[release|debug]] [client|server]` - to build either client or server (default build in debug mode)

## Features
ToDo
